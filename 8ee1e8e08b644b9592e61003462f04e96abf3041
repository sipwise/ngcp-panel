This path ../../zones/ajax become incorrect, and as far as we cache form - tayed incorrect.\n\nI didn\u0027t really reproduce, but we met similar issues with cached forms already. Really, I think, the best solution here may be set path from action here. And don\u0027t forget to reset it considering every place where this form is used.",
