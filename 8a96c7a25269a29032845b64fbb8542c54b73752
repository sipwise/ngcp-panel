      "message": "caller: is the number / username\nsource: in this case is the \"source\" identifier where the call came from, it uses \"dom_preferences\" / \"peer_preference\" identifier. Also in the future it could be also as a logic of dom/peer identifier ? identifier : ip or something. So I think that \"source\" is a common description of the call source. \nCan also rename it into \"call_source\" if it sounds better. :)",
