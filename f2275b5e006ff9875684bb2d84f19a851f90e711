Isn\u0027t it?\n\nI thought about that for the very same reasons, I decided to do it with tmpfiles.d because we did it that way for sems, and because it would mean several chained commands of ExecStartPre.\n\n\n \u003e BTW, maybe we do not need this at all?

Could any of you ask ngcp-panel people or read the Perl code?",
