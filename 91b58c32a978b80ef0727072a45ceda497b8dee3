      "message": "And a little clarification from my side:\n\nI wasn\u0027t sure that _enabling_ should also be part of the openvpn management from the panel, together with _start_ of already enabled service, Manuel mentioned it, so I added these steps too:\n\n1. check if not enabled service is presented: systemctl list-unit-files\n2. enable service: systemctl enable openvpn.service\n\nI suppose that this step may be eliminated by management tool provided by Core team.\n\nNow after the steps above we check service is enabled:\nsystemctl is-enabled openvpn@ovpn\n\nif it is enabled, we check if it is not running:\nsystemctl is-active openvpn@ovpn\n\nAnd then start it, if necessary:\nsystemctl start openvpn@ovpn",
