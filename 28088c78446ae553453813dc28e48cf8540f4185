      "message": "I do have a local change here which extends the send_sms to specify the coding based on the characters available (e.g. uses coding\u003d0 for sms containing purely ascii to leverage the full length of 160 chars in the sms, and only falls back to utf-8 encoding if non-ascii characters are there, because in that case only 70 chars are possible per sms.\n\nAlso I\u0027ve already introduced more params in the sms_journal, so please hold on merging this change until I\u0027ve finished my change. I\u0027ll submit it then for review, and we can unify it then.",
