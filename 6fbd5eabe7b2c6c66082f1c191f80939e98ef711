      "message": "that is not how it is supposed to be, not how it was discussed and not how it is described in the task description.\n\nthe request was to have a \"Copy from a Template\" button.\n\n(quoted from the task: - is there a button \"Copy from a Template\" in the Email Template UI part, next to \"Create Email Template\" ? )\n\nThe whole purpose of it is that you can always copy a template from one of the default ones (reseller_id \u003d NULL). One of the reasons is if you on the UI delete a reseller template (or a reseller is created without reseller copied templates) there is no way to recreate it.\n\nI would highly suggest you to either read carefully the requirements or ask if something is even a little unclear to you, I am there to help you anytime for a reason...\n\nP.S. Deployed the PPA, getting \"Oops, Not found\" when pressing the \"Copy\" button.",
