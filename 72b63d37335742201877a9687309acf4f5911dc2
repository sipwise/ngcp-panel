If a cmdline (like RUN) is modified inside a Dockerfile its checksum is different and then it\u0027s not considered for usage from cache (since such a cached layer doesn\u0027t exist). So a change to ENV REFRESHED_AT isn\u0027t necessary then. The REFRESHED_AT really just is a hack to force a full refresh of all the following commands without relying on any (possibly existing) caches (e.g. if an underlying Debian repository was changed and the `apt-get update` should be run against the most current version). Of course there\u0027s no big deal to always update REFRESHED_AT when modifying Dockerfile.",
