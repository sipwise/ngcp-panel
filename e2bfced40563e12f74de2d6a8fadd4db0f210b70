      "message": "If this package is intended to contain just perl modules, then the convention is to normalize the package name to lib\u003cmodules-root\u003e-perl where modules in the hierarchy root are lowercased and :: mapped to -. In addition if this module hierarchy is intended to be used for unit tests, as you\u0027d use something like Test::More, then the convention I guess is also to use the Test namespace, so I\u0027d use Test::NGCP::\u003c...\u003e.",

      "message": "fully agreed with the convention in general, however it may contain not only perl modules in the future, also it is not a general use library but rather fully dependent on ngcp-panel (REST API part).\nas for Test::NGCP usage. it is very convenient from the everyday use perspective when code that belong to NGCP reside under NGCP::. Otherwise one may need to know that there will be NGCP/Panel , NGCP/API, NGCP::Schema, etc. but Test/NGCP, which is not convenient. so the purpose it to keep it under our NGCP/... sandbox.",

      "message": "IMO, if there\u0027s need for some binaries, we can always create a new separate package, or similar, I don\u0027t think we do generally worry about the number of binary packages we create (which is pretty tiny anyway :).\n\nAbout the namespace, I\u0027ve also had similar concerns for example with dpkg, but ended up using a Test::Dpkg hierarchy anyway as that seemed more correct, and we already do need to use other namespaces due to requirements from frameworks, such as to hook into the Catalyst one. So I think using conventions that are prevalent within perl development is more important here, as to look for perl modules you\u0027d need to grep just for NGCP, instead of looking into specific directories, where you\u0027d need to also look under /usr/share/perl5 or /usr/lib/*/perl*/, etc. Or just run something like «apropos NGCP::». :)",
